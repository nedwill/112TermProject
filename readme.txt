Overview:
This application is an extension of the typical calendar system that makes real time
decisions about schedule efficiency. When given tasks with deadlines, it creates the
optimal schedule to suit the situation. The user then can spend less time managing their
schedule with the confidence that it has been optimized intelligently.

Installation:
This application requires the icalendar package, a copy of which has been included
in the root folder of this project.
It can be installed with the command "python setup.py install" when the user is in
the directory.
The project can then be run by simply running the main.py file.

Saved Data:
This application saves data to a cal.pkl file, and a copy of this file has been
included containing sample data. If you wish, you can delete this file to begin
again or simply use the "Clear All Data" file to generate a new data file for your
use.

In addition, a standardized iCalendar file for use with other calendar applications
and web services can be exported. If you prefer to simply use this program to generate
a schedule, the *.ics file you generate can be used with services like iCloud or Google
Calendar to provide you with reminders.

You can also receive a text message containing your selected agenda if you use a major
provider in the United States (listed within the program).
